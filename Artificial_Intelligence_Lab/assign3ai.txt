Lab 1 : Introduction to ChatGPT
Introduction:
AI models like ChatGPT are transforming in the way we interact with technology. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is a conversational AI built on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. It can understand, generate, and respond to text in a human-like manner.
How It Works (In Simple Terms):
ChatGPT uses the Transformer architecture, which was introduced in 2017. It’s trained on a large amount of text data and uses self-attention mechanisms to understand context. The training happens in two main stages:
1. Pre-training: The model learns general language patterns from massive datasets.
2. Fine-tuning: The model is improved using feedback from real human responses (using RLHF – Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).
Visualization tools like attention maps help us understand how the model "pays attention" to different parts of input text while generating responses.
Key Capabilities of ChatGPT:
* Natural language conversations
* Writing help (essays, stories, code, emails)
* Code generation and debugging (Python, C++, Java, etc.)
* Summarization and language translation
* Image understanding (in GPT-4o)
Real life scenario: Use Case: College Student Support (Education Sector).
A student is having difficulty comprehending the Merge Sort algorithm in Data Structures.
What ChatGPT do: 
* The student initiates ChatGPT and enters:
* "Explain merge sort in simple terms with an example in C++."
How ChatGPT Reacts:
* ChatGPT rapidly processes the question, knows the subject, and comes up with an easy-to-understand explanation accompanied by C++ code for merge sort. It can even provide step-by-step output or discuss time complexity.
Conclusion:
ChatGPT is a powerful example of how AI is changing industries. As an AI & DS student, learning how it works helps me understand real-world AI implementation. It’s not just about theory anymore—tools like ChatGPT show us how AI can solve real problems across fields like education, business, and healthcare.
